Which State to Use?

1.Simple, Local State: Use useState for simple state management within a component.

2.Shared State Across Components: Use Context or a global state management library like Zustand or Redux.


3.Server-Side Data: Use data-fetching libraries like React Query or Apollo Client.

4.Complex Form State: Use specialized form libraries like React Hook Form.

5.Derived State: Calculate it on the fly using useMemo or inside the render method.
